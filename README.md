# TheSimDiary 
## About this app ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Are you an aviation enthusiast? Do you regularly simulate flights on a desktop or a mobile simulator? Well to make your experience ever so slightly more realistic, I bring to you, what I'd like to call 'The Sim Diary'. Everytime you complete simulating a flight from one place to another, simply log that flight into this app and gain 'sim hours'. The use of this application is very straight forward, however, it is important that you read this document and understand it thoroughly to make full use of this app.
